# DiscordBot

***This app was created following a freeCodeCamp guide and replit***

With this discord bot each time a word related to sadness appears in the chat it will prompt a cheerful message.
I developed this app to learn how to use the discord.py package and practicing decorators and helper functions.

To run this app on your pc you need to have python and pip installed. Then use pip to install discord.py, that should be it for the local setup, but for further instructions check out https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/   

*In Discord* commands:

- **$inspire** prompts a random inspiring quote. Eg:
> $inspire   
> *To be or not to be, that is the question. -William Shakespeare*   

- **$uplift** can be used to turn on or off the cheering function. By default it is On
> $uplift On   
> Happy to see you!

- The cheering message will prompt automatically everytime it detects a word related to sadness. This is a hardcoded list for now.
> Guys I'm so sad   
> Hang in there! You're doing great

- The cheering messages are also a hardcoded list but with the option to extend it self using the replit db.
- **$new** is used to add a cheering message
> $new What are you talking about, you are the best!   
> new cheerful message added

- **$del** is used to delete a cheering message.
> $del *index of the cheerful message you want to delete*   
> *Cheerful message* Deleted
